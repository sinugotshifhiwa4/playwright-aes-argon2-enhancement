# Playwright AES-Argon2 Encryption Enhancement

## Overview

This repository provides a robust encryption-enhanced testing setup using **Playwright**, **TypeScript**, **AES-GCM**, and **Argon2**. It enables secure management of credentials during test automation.

---

## Getting Started

Ensure **Node.js** is installed. Then, install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Environment Setup

Before running any tests, configure the environment and encryption variables.

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the sample environment configuration:

```bash
cp envs/.env.dev.example envs/.env.dev
```

Then, update the newly created `.env.dev` file with your credentials:

```env
PORTAL_USERNAME=your.username
PORTAL_PASSWORD=your.password
```

> ℹ️ The root `.env` file is managed automatically—**do not modify it manually**.

---

## Encryption Workflows

All sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-GCM** and secured with **Argon2** hashing.

### Encryption Commands

#### 1. Generate Secret Key

Run this first to create a secure encryption key:

```bash
npx cross-env PLAYWRIGHT_GREP="@generate-key" npm run test:encryption:dev
```

#### 2. Encrypt Credentials

After generating the key, encrypt your `.env` credentials:

```bash
npx cross-env PLAYWRIGHT_GREP="@encrypt-vars" npm run test:encryption:dev
```

> 💡 Replace `dev` with your environment: `uat`, `prod`, etc. Ensure a `.env.<env>` file exists.

---

## Encryption Workflows

All sensitive data is encrypted using **AES-GCM** and secured with **Argon2** hashing.

### Encryption Commands

Run encryption-related workflows using tagged tests. Use the `PLAYWRIGHT_GREP` variable to specify the operation.

```bash
npx cross-env PLAYWRIGHT_GREP="@<tag>" npm run test:encryption:<env>
```

> 💡 Replace `<tag>` with the desired operation (see table below), and `<env>` with your environment (`dev`, `uat`, `prod`, etc.).
> Ensure a `.env.<env>` file exists before running the command.

## Best Practices & Notes

- ❌ **Never commit `.env` files** to version control.
- 🔄 **Regenerate encryption keys** whenever credentials change.
- 📦 Always run `npm install` after switching branches or pulling updates.
- 🔐 Reuse authentication state to improve performance and test reliability.
- 🔒 Secrets are securely managed using encrypted storage.
- ✅ Fully CI-compatible and built for scalable test automation.
